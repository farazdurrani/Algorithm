# Algorithm
Algorithm Practice such as divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithm, dynamic programming, etc

So far, this repo contains practice for:

* InsertionSort
* MergeSort
* QuickSort
* HeapSort
* MaxProrityQueue
* MinPriorityQueue
* MaximumSubArray Divide and Conquer and Brute Force approaches
* Matrix Multiplication Brute Force approach
* Single LinkedList (and Queues and Stacks).
* Double LinkedList

LinkedList contains all standard operations including removing a specific element and reversing it. 

* Binary Search Tree 

BST contains the following operations:

* BST Operations:
  - Invert
  - Insert (both iterative and recursive)
  - Find (both iterative and recursive)
  - Remove (both iterative and recursive)
  - Height
  - Level Order Traversal (Iterative and Queue approaches (separate))
  - Pre, In, and Post traversals recursive and iterative
  - Successor (by keeping track of parent node. And without tracking parent node)
  - Predecessor (by keeping track of parent node. And without tracking parent node)
  - min and max (both iterative and recursive)


* Red Black Tree
  - Insert and InsertRBFix
  - Delete and DeleteRBFix

* HashTable (Using LinkedList in each bucket)

* Dynamic Programming (memoization)
  - Cut Rod using top-down and bottom-up approaches.
  - Longest Common Subsequence (naive recursive approach and DP-approach)
